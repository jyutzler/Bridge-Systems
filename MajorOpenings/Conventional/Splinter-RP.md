#### Splinter Raises
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening, a double jump shows 13+ dummy points,
4+ card support, and shortness in the suit bid (either a singleton or void).
Opener can explore slam by bidding controls or attempt to sign off by bidding game.
For example:

1♠ — 4♣ = game forcing, club shortness
   * 4♦, 4♥ = slam interest, first round control (usually ace)
   * 4♠ = signoff

Responder shows a void by rebidding the splinter suit:

1♠ — 4♣ 

4♥ — 5♣ = void

Opener can also splinter with a good hand and 4-card support:

1♣ — 1♠
   * 4♦, 4♥ = game forcing, shortness

In competition, splinters are off except for jumps in the opponent's suit.

Note: This is the treatment recommended by Richard Pavlicek as described in this [quiz](http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/quiz.pl?5h4100).
