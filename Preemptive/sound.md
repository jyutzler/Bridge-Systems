# Preemptive Bids
Opening suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive, usually showing 7 cards at the 3-level and 8 cards at the 4-level. They are sound, roughly in accordance with the rule of 500 - you expect to take seven tricks vulnerable, six tricks non-vulnerable out of your own hand.
