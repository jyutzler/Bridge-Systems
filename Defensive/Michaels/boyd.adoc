### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

** If the opening is in a minor suit, the cuebid shows the majors; 
** If the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

The strength is wide-ranging.
When vulnerable, it is usually best to avoid very weak hands. 
When non-vulnerable, the low-end range is much wider.
