### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

 * If the opening is in a minor suit, the cuebid shows the majors; 
 * If the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.
When vulnerable, it is best to avoid very weak hands. 
(This also makes it easier for advancer to decide to bid game.)
When non-vulnerable, the low-end range is much wider. 

#### Responses to a Minor Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
1. 2NT: Invitational
1. Opponent's suit: Game or slam try

#### Responses to a Major Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
2. Jump in major: Weak if below game
1. 2NT: asks for overcaller’s minor.
 * If advancer then returns to the major, this is invitational.
 * If there is further interference, 4NT may also ask for the minor.

#### Rare Responses to Either Cuebid

2. Jump in major: Good support, but weak if below game
1. Unbid minor (no further interference): Weak
1. 3NT: To play

#### Overcaller Rebids
Overcaller will normally have a weak hand and will pass or make a minimum response. 
With a strong hand or freakier distribution, overcaller will make some other bid.
