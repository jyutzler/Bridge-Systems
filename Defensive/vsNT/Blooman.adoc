### Blooman vs 1NT
Blooman is a simple defense to 1NT with only one artificial bid:

* Double: 5-5 in at least one major
* 2NT: Minors
* Others: Natural (typically unbalanced with Weak 2 or Overcall strength at the 2-level, preemptive at the 3-level)

These bids may be made in either the direct or balancing seats.

#### Without Interference
After double, advancer is expected to relay to 2♣. 
After the relay, overcaller shows the actual distribution:

* 2♦: both majors (weak or intermediate)
* 2♥: hearts and a minor 
* 2♠: spades and a minor
* 2NT: minors (strong)
* 3♦: majors (strong)
* 3♥: hearts (strong)
* 3♠: spades (strong)

After a 2♥ or 2♠ response, advancer may bid 2NT to request the minor.

#### With Additional Interference
When responder transfers to a major over partner's double and 
advancer holds two or more of that major, 
we know that responder has five of the other major and an unknown minor.
With this in mind, advancer can show support as follows:

* Double: three-card support
* Other major: four-card support
* 2NT: support for either minor
