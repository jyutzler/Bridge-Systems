### Landy vs 1NT
#### Unpassed Hand
Landy is a simple defense to 1NT with only one artificial bid:

 * Double: Penalty
 * 2♣: Majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
 * 2NT: Minors
 * Others: Natural

After 2♣, advancer generally bids the better major.

 * pass: No major, long clubs
 * 2♦: No preference
 * 2♥, 2♠: Weak, sign-off
 * 2NT: Forcing, invitational in either major
 * 3♥, 3♠: Limit raise
 * 4♥, 4♠: To play

#### Passed Hand
Since it is impossible to have a penalty double as a passed hand,
double is a relay to 2♣.
