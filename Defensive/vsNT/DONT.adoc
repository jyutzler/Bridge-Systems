### DONT vs. Strong 1NT
DONT features multiple ways to show single-suited or 5-5 hands (4-5 distribution is possible when non-vulnerable).  

 * double: single-suited or 18+ HCP 
 * 2♣: clubs and a higher suit
 * 2♦: diamonds and a higher suit
 * 2♥: majors
 * 2♠: spades (normal weak 2 or worse in strength; use double followed by 2♠ to show a better hand)
 * 2NT: six-card major and five-card minor

Advancer responses:

 * pass or bid of a shown suit: fit, unconstructive
 * next higher suit: relay (pass or correct)
 * pass of double is for penalty and rare
 * new suit: single-suited
 * jump or raise in shown suit: invitational (8-9 points)
 * 2NT: forcing (15+ points)
