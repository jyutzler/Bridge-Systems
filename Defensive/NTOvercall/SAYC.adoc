### NT Overcalls
#### Direct
Because of the reduced bidding space available, the structure for NT overcalls is as follows:

   * 12-14 pass
   * 15-18 overcall 1NT
   * 19-21 double then raise NT
   * 22-24 double then jump NT
   
A 1NT overcall shows 15–18 points and a balanced hand (preferably a stopper in
opener’s suit). No conventional responses are used to the 1NT overcall except 2♣,
which is Stayman.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 19-21 points.

#### Reopening
In the reopening position, NT overcalls become more aggressive as follows:

   * 12-14 overcall 1NT
   * 15-18 double then bid NT
   * 19-21 jump to 2NT
   * 22-24 double then jump NT

When non-vulnerable, a 1NT overcall may be made with as little as 10 points.
This is a wide range, but there will not usually be a game on for you.

#### Vs. Preempts
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in notrump is natural.
