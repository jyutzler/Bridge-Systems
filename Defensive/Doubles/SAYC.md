### Doubles
A double is for takeout over a partscore bid (4♦ or lower). 
In the direct position over a 1-level bid, it shows about 13+ total points and support for the unbid suits or 18+ points and any distribution. 
In the balancing position it can be 2-3 points lighter.

Advancer is expected to bid after a takeout double. 
The Rule of 9 (#cards + #honors + bid level >= 9) is a reasonable guideline to determine when to convert the double to penalty.
With insufficient strength and no compelling suit, a 1NT bid is permissible. 
Unlike in other bidding situations, bid four-card suits highest first. 
In some cases this will allow you to show your second suit and give partner a choice of places to play. 

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational (9-12 declarer points). 
To force for one round, responder cuebids opener’s suit. 
This is forcing to game by an unpassed hand.

Any subsequent bid by doubler shows significant extras and is strongly invitational to game. 
If advancer has jumped, then a new suit or NT bid by doubler is forcing to game.

Over opening game bids (4♥ or higher), a double is for penalty.
However, advancer may pull the double with undisclosed distribution and/or poor defensive values.
