#### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
(It may show 2=2=4=5 distribution but in that case it should be a king stronger.)

(1♦) - 2NT: hearts and clubs

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the overcaller shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.

Note: Unusual 2NT may be off in the reopening seat (see NT Overcalls above).

#### Unusual 4NT
In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Over an opening 4♠ bid, 4NT is takeout, showing at least two places to play.
