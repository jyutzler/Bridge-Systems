### Self-Splinters
The following bids are self-splinters, showing a maximum (usually 17+ HCP), shortness, and game-forcing / slam interest:

   * A double jump-shift after a 1/1 bid
   * A jump shift after a raise
   * A jump shift in a game-forcing auction (suit agreement on the last shown suit, but the hand can be less powerful)

Responder is expected to bid a first round control if possible.
