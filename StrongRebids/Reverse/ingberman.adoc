### Reverses (with Ingberman)
After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows a good 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit. 
(HCP strength can be lowered in cases of extreme distribution.)
Bidding the cheapest unbid strain is the only weak response. 
It is a relay to the next higher bid (pass or correct). In cases of extreme strength and/or distribution, Opener may bypass the relay.

All other bids by responder are natural and forcing to game. 
A rebid of a major shows a decent 5+ card suit.
