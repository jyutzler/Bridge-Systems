### Reverses
After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit.
It is forcing for one round. 
Responder has two weak responses:

 * A rebid at the two-level shows 5+ cards in the suit
 * 2NT denies 5+ cards

Both of these responses are forcing for one round. 
Without good support, opener will usually retreat to the first suit.
The exception is when there is another unbid four-card suit (e.g., 5-0-4-4 distribution).

All other bids by responder are natural and forcing to game.
