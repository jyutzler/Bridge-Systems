### Penalty Doubles
A double is unequivocally for penalty in the following cases:

  * After a game contract by the opponents
  * After a natural NT bid by any player
  * After two previous doubles by either partner
  * After partner has bid or doubled over an opposing preempt and preempter's partner has raised

#### Lightner Doubles
A double of a NT or slam contract is Lightner, asking for a specific lead such as:

  * dummy's first bid suit
  * a suit doubler has not shown

#### Lead-Directing Doubles
In fourth position or after a pass, double of an artificial bid is lead-directing. 
To make the bid, doubler must be confident that:

   * the lead will be helpful
   * the opponents will not be able to make the contract redoubled
