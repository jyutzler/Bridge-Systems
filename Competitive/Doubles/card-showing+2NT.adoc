### Card-Showing Doubles
In a competitive auction below game, a double is card-showing and major-oriented. 
Partner is requested to do something intelligent, such as:

* Show secondary support for a previously bid suit
* Rebid an extra-long or extra-strong suit
* Bid a previously unbid four-card suit
* Bid NT with at least one good stopper
* Convert to penalty (usually with a decent four cards)

### Competitive 2NT
In a competitive auction below game, a 2NT bid is artificial (takeout) and minor-oriented.
Partner is expected to bid the logical minor at the cheapest level.
When 2NT is available as an artificial bid, 
a direct bid of a minor is invitational.
