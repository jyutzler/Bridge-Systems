### Against Conventions
After partner opens in a suit and a conventional bid by the opponents shows one known suit, 
a cue bid shows a good raise, a double shows a good hand without support, and other bids are weak. 
For example:

1♠ — (2♠:Michaels) 

   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: weak
   * 3♥: Limit raise or better in spades.
   * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

If the conventional bid shows two known suits, 
there are two cue bids available and the second shows the fourth suit. 
For example:

1♣ — (2NT:Unusual) 

   * 3♣, 3♠: weak
   * 3♦: Limit raise or better in clubs.
   * 3♥: 10+HCP, 5+ spades
   * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.
