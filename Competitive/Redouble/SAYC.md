## Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.
