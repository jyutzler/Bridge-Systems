### Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 

* your side is at the four level or higher:
** 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble: Penalty
* the opponents double a conventional bid:
** 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double); Redouble: Penalty, good diamond suit;
* the opponents make a penalty double of 1NT and partner passes:
** 1NT — (Double) — pass — (pass); Redouble: Penalty, responder passes or scrambles;

A good hand if: 

* their double is for takeout:
** 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:

* your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit

at the three level or lower:

* 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double); Pass — (Pass) — Redouble: SOS, responder can support at least two of the unbid suits.
