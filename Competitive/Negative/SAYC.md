## Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 2♠ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid
major. Bidding a major at the two level or higher shows 11 or more points and a
five-card or longer suit.

1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.

1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).

1♦— (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–10 points.
