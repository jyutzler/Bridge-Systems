There is almost an endless variety of possible sequences, so it pays to have simple
guidelines to prevent bidding misunderstandings.

Bids mean the same things they meant without the intervening bid. Still, it is
sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠J43 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣J3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)
