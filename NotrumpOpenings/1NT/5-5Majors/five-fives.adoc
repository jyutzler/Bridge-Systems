#### 2-level:
A transfer at the 2-level is used with certain hands with the majors.

 * Transfer to the weaker major and pass: bust
 * 2♦(transfer) followed by 2♠: 6 hearts, slam try (request to cue bid)
 * 2♥(transfer) followed by 3♥: 6 spades, slam try (request to cue bid)

#### 3-level: 5-5 hands
The 3-level is used to show most 5-5 hands.

 * 3♣: 5-5 minors, less than game-forcing
 ** any bid other than pass or 3♦ accepts an invitation; with a weak hand responder attempts to sign off in 4 of a minor
 * 3♦: 5-5 minors, game forcing
 * 3♥: 5-5 majors, invitational
 * 3♠: 5-5 majors, choice of games

#### 4-level
 * 4♣: Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
 * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).
