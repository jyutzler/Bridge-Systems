#### Smolen 5-4 or better in the Majors
If responder is weak, transfer to the five-card major and pass.
Otherwise use a Stayman to show 5-4 in the majors as follows:

1NT — 2♣; 2♦:

 * 2♥ or 2♠: that major, invitational
 * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing

Over 2NT, a similar system applies but there are no invitational bids:

2NT — 3♣; 3♦:

 * pass: weak  (5-4=4=0 distribution)
 * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing

Smolen does not apply over 3NT.
