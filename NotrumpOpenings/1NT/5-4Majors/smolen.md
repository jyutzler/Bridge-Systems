#### Smolen 5-4 or better in the Majors
Unless responder is weak, 5-4 in the majors is shown with a Stayman sequence as follows:

   * 2♣, pass: weak, four diamonds
   * transfer to five-card major, pass: weak, less than four diamonds
   * 2♣, 2♥ or 2♠: that major, invitational
   * 2♣, 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 2♣, 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)
