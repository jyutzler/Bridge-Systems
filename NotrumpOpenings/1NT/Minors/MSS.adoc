#### Minor Suit Stayman
A 2♠ response shows at least an invitational hand with strength in both minors.

1NT — 2♠

 * 2NT = weak hand, usually stoppers in both majors
 * 3♣, ♦ = weak hand, good support 
 * 3♥, ♠ = strong hand, stopper, could have a good minor (only forcing response)
 * 3NT = strong hand, stoppers in both majors
 * 4♣, ♦ = strong hand, good support

From there, responder should have enough information to proceed using methods described elsewhere.
