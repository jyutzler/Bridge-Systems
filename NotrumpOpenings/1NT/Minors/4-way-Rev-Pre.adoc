#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor.
Super-accept (if willing to play 3NT opposite KQxxxx and out) by bidding what you like.

* 2♠: transfer to clubs
** 2NT: normal response
** 3♣: preacceptance (good support)
* 2NT: transfer to diamonds
** 3♣: normal response (note: this is non-forcing, giving responder a way out of the auction with a 5-5 weak hand)
** 3♦: preacceptance (good support)

After the transfer, responder can bid again to show extra length or strength:

* New suit: shortness, mild slam try
* 3NT: balanced, mild slam try
* Raise to 4: invitational
* Raise to 5: sign-off

When using this treatment, responder bids 2♣ (Stayman) with any game invitational hand. 
A rebid of 2NT over a 2♦ or 2♠ response shows an invitational hand that may or may not have a four-card major.
