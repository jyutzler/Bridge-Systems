#### Over Interference
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

1NT — (Double) — 2♣ = Stayman

1NT — (Double) — 2♦ = transfer to hearts

With a bad hand and a weak minor, redouble for SOS.

1NT — (Double) — Redouble = Rescue - weak with a long minor (opener bids 2♣, pass or correct).

Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents at the 2-level is for penalty.

Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents at the 3-level or higher is for negative, promising at least one major.

Jacoby Transfers are on over 2♣.

Double of an artificial 2♣ = Stayman, does not imply invitational or better values. 

Cue bid of opponent's natural suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥ = Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts

Suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.

 * 2♥, 2♠ = To play, 5+.
 * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
 * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
