#### Over 2♣
Jacoby Transfers are on over 2♣.

Double of an artificial 2♣ = Stayman, does not imply invitational or better values.

#### Over Other Overcalls
Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents is negative, showing at least one major.
It is primarily for takeout, but may be converted to penalty with the right hand.

Cue bid of opponent's natural suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

Suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.

   * 2♥, 2♠ = To play, 5+.
   * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.

#### Interference With Conventions
If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

For example: 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double)
   * Redouble: Suggestion to play (rare)
   * Pass: Only two hearts
      * Redouble: retransfer
      * Others: same as without interference
   * 2♥: Real fit for hearts
