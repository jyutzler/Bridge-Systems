When the opponents interfere with a 1NT opener, 
a conventional 2NT response is used to show a wider range of hand types.

1NT(2X)
* Double: 
   * Penalty (if the opponent's bid was natural)
   * Penalty in at least one shown suit (if the opponent's bid was artificial)
   * Negative if the opponent's bid is 3♣ or higher 
(since Responder rarely has a true Penalty Double here)
* 2Y: 
   * sign-off (if the suit is unshown)
   * takeout (if the suit is shown)
* 2NT: Relay to 3♣
* 3Y: Natural, 1 round force
* 3X (Cue): Stayman, denying a stopper
* 3NT: Game values, denying a stopper
* 4♦/4♥: Texas

#### Responses after the 3♣ Relay
* 3Y, below opponent's suit: sign-off
* 3X (Cue): Stayman, showing a stopper
* 3Y, above opponent's suit: natural, invitational
* 3NT: Game values, showing a stopper
