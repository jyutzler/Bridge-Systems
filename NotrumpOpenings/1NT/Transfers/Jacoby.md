#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major. 
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 2♥ = transfer to spades

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level 
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, 
that is natural and game forcing. 
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠
   * Pass: content to play 2♠
   * 2NT: invitational with a five-card suit
      * Pass or 3♠: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * 3♣, 3♦ = natural and game forcing (4+)
   * 3♠: invitational with a six-card suit
      * pass: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * 3NT: asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠
   * 4♣: Gerber
   * 4NT: quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit
