Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is especially strong. 
The following semi-balanced hands may be treated as balanced:

 * 5-4-2-2 (unless the length is in both majors)
 * 6-3-2-2 (unless the length is in a major)
 * 5-4-3-1 or 4-4-4-1 (if the length is not in both majors, the singleton is Q or better, and rebid problems are likely)

The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:

 * 12-14: Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT
 * 15-17: Open 1NT
 * 18-19: Open 1♣, rebid 1NT or an artificial bid
 * 20-21: Open 2NT
 * 22-24: Open 2♣, rebid NT
 * 25-27: Open 3NT
 * 28+: Open 2♣, jump NT

When non-vulnerable, these point ranges drop by a point.
These point ranges are not exact; 
hands are upgraded or downgraded due to texture.
