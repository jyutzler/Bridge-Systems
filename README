This repository contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes a bridge system, 
in this case Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) as described at 
http://www.acbl.org/documentlibrary/play/SP3%20(bk)%20single%20pages.pdf.

Do not edit system.md directly. It is generated by executing gen.bat in the Windows PowerShell.

Fork this repository to create system notes for your own system. 
If you have your own conventions or treatments, describe them in separate .md files and add them to the batch file.
Even better, issue a pull request so that your additions are available to others.
