A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality 
and roughly 4–10 HCP, but flexible based on vulnerability and position. 
On rare occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. 
It is possible to open a weak two with a poor seven-card suit 
(not good enough to open with at the three level)
but in MP scoring three level bids are pretty lenient. 

Responses:

* New suit: forcing
** Raise of responder's suit: honor-doubleton or better
** Retreat: no outside strength
** New suit: strength in that suit 
** 3NT: solid suit (AKJxxx or better)
* 2NT: forcing, showing game interest (on in competition) 
** New suit: feature (usually A or K in that suit)
** Rebid of 3: good suit
** 3♣: either a feature in clubs or a bad hand; responder may relay 3♦ to inquire further  
** 3NT: solid suit (AKJxxx or better)
* Any raise: to play, preemptive
* 3NT: to play (typically a good hand with three-card support)
