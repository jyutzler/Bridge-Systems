A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. On rare
occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. It is possible to open a weak two with
a poor seven-card suit (not good enough to open with at the three level). 

Responses:

A 2NT response is forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) Opener rebids his suit with a
minimum weak two (5–8 points). With a maximum hand opener bids another
suit to show a “feature” (ace or king in that suit); 
with a solid suit (AKJxxx or better) he raises to 3NT.

Any raise of opener’s suit is to play and could be preemptive. 

A 3NT response is also to play.

“RONF” on the card means “Raise Only Non-Force.” A new-suit response is forcing
one round and shows at least a five-card suit. Opener should raise a major suit
response with a three-card fit, or perhaps with a doubleton honor.

With no fit for responder’s suit, opener rebids:

 * With a minimum weak two-bid (5–8 points), rebid the suit at the lowest level.
 * With a maximum weak two-bid, name a new suit or bid notrump.
