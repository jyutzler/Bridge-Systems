#### Responder's Rebids
Responder promises to bid a second time unless unless opener’s rebid is at the game level, 
since opener could have 18 points (just short of a jump shift rebid). 
(This applies when responder is an unpassed hand.)
If responder bids a second time, it is either in support of opener or an attempt to find a NT contract.
A subsequent jump raise of opener’s first suit to the THREE LEVEL is game 
forcing — responder should make a limit raise directly over the opening with 10–11 
points and at least three-card support:

1♠ — 2♣;
2♦ — 2NT, 3♣, 3♦: invitation to game (10–11 points).

* 2♠: preference, not forcing. Responder has 11–12 points and a doubleton spade.
* 2♥: game force, could be conventional
* 3♠: game force

1♠ — 2♣;
2♥ — 2NT, 3♣, 3♥: invitation to game (10–11 points).
