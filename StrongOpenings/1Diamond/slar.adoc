A 1♦ opening shows balanced, semi-balanced, and single-suited hands with 18+ HCPs and unbalanced hands with 22+ HCPs. If the system uses a 14-16 range for a strong NT, then adjust the point range for opening hands accordingly.
In general responder acts as if opener is balanced. In most cases this allows opener to be declarer. Many forcing responses and rebids are dual-ranged. A jump or artificial bid the following round shows the higher range.
