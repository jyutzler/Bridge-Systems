A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points, or the playing equivalent (9+ tricks). 

Responses:

2♣ 

 * 2♦: conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response.
 * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural and game forcing. At least a five-card suit and
8 points or the playing equivalent with a longer suit.
 * 2NT: 8+ HCP, balanced.

If opener rebids 2NT after a 2♦ response (showing 22–24 points), the same
responses are used as over a 2NT opening (see above).

If opener rebids a suit over a 2♦ response, the bidding is forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor.

2♣ — 2♦

2♥ — 2♠

3♥: not forcing.
