A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points, or the playing equivalent. 

Responses:

2♣ — 2♦= conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response.

   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦= natural and game forcing. At least a five-card suit and
8 points.

   * 2NT = a balanced 8 HCP.

If opener rebids 2NT after a 2♦ response (showing 22–24 points), the same
responses are used as over a 2NT opening:

2♣ — 2♦

2NT — 3♣ = Stayman.

   * 3♦, 3♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively.
   * 4♣ = Gerber.
   * 4NT = inviting a slam in notrump.

If opener rebids a suit over a 2♦ response, the bidding is forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor.

2♣ — 2♦

2♥ — 2♠

3♥ = not forcing.
