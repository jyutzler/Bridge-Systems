#### New Minor Forcing
A new minor suit at the responder's second bid or later is forcing for one round and thus
is invitational at the 2-level and game forcing at the 3-level.
When more than one minor is available (1♥-1♠;1NT-2m),
it tends to show a stopper for NT.

Example: 1♣-1♠;1NT (or 2♣)-2♦ (forcing)

After New Minor Forcing, opener must describe his hand further.
The following bids are in order of priority:
* 3 of other major: 4 cards, extras (preacceptance)
* 2 of other major: 4 cards, minimum
* 3 of responder's suit: 3-card support, extras (preacceptance)
* 2 of responder's suit: 3-card support, minimum
* 2NT: minimum (with stoppers if 2♦ is available)
* 2♦ (if available): minimum, not willing to declare in NT
* 3NT: to play (maximum)

If opener has rebid 1NT,
rebids should be designed to find a suit contract.
* raise new minor: extras, stopper, forcing to 3NT or higher

If opener has rebid his suit,
rebids should be designed to find a 3NT contract
* raise other minor: 4-cards, extras
* rebid opener's suit: retreat (minimum, no stopper in new minor)
