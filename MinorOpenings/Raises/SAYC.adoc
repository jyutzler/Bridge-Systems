Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣, 
though one fewer trump will do in a pinch in a competitive sequence).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.

 * Single raise = weak
 * Double raise = invitational
 * Triple raise or more = weak freak
 * There is no forcing minor-suit raise.
