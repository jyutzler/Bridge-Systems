Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.
Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better) 
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive). When vulnerable, a jump raise should be 
sound (8-9 dummy points) but when non-vulnerable it is much more wide-ranging.

1♦ - 2♦

   * 2♥, 2♠: stopper
   * 2NT: balanced minimum, side suits stopped
   * 3♦: unbalanced minimum
   * 3NT: 18-19, side suits stopped

Inverted raises are on over a double but not an overcall.
