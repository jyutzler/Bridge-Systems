## Grand Slam Force
A jump to 5NT (and some 5NT bids when the auction is at the five level) is “Grand
Slam Force,” asking partner to bid a grand slam with two of the three top trump
honors:

5NT
   * 6 of the trump suit = fewer than two top trump honors (A, K, or Q).
   * 7 of the trump suit = two of the three top trump honors.
