### Voluntary 5-bid
A voluntary bid of 5 of a suit is invitational to slam.
It is used in two circumstances: 
   * If opponents have bid one suit or there is one unbid suit, it asks for second-round control in that suit. Responder:
      * Bids 5NT with an unguarded K to invite an alternative contract of 6NT
	  * Raises to 6 with first or second-round control
	  * Passes otherwise
   * Otherwise, it asks for top trump honors. Responder 
      * Raises to 7 with AK and the Q or extra length
	  * Raises to 6 with at least AJ or KQ
	  * Passes otherwise
