# General Approach 
Standard American with 5 Card Majors

Strong forcing opening: 2&clubs;
# Notrump Opening Bids 
Notrump openings show a balanced hand. It is permissible to have a five-card major suit provided the hand is otherwise suitable for notrump.
## 1NT 15-17 
### Basic Responses
2NT = Invitational 8-9

3NT = sign-off

### Non-forcing Stayman
2â™£ is â€œnon-forcingâ€ Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit.

Opener rebids 2â™¥ with 4â€“4 in the majors. If responder rebids three of either minor,
he shows slam interest and at least a five-card suit.
### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby transfer that shows a five-card suit is used for the majors: 2â™¦ is a
transfer to hearts, 2â™¥ is a transfer to spades. Opener accepts the transfer, though
he can jump to the three level with 17 points and four-card support for responderâ€™s
major. For example:

1NT â€” 2â™¦

   * 2â™¥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3â™¥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, that is natural and
game forcing. Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT â€” 2â™¥ â€” 2â™ 
   * Pass = content to play 2â™ .
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3â™ 
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4â™  with a maximum.
   * 3â™  = invitational with a six-card suit. Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4â™  with a maximum.
   * 3â™£, 3â™¦, 3â™¥ = natural and game forcing.
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4â™ .
   * 4â™  = placing the contract, with a six-card or longer suit.
### 2 Spades
A 2â™  response requires the 1NT bidder to rebid 3â™£, which may be passed with a
club bust, or responder may rebid 3â™¦ with a diamond bust. Example:

1NT â€” 2â™  â€” 3â™£ 
   * Pass = club bust
   * 3â™¦ = diamond bust (notrump opener passes).
### Other Responses
   * 3â™£, 3â™¦ = a six-card or longer suit and invitational to 3NT.
   * 3â™¥, 3â™  = at least a six-card suit and slam interest (otherwise,
responder uses a transfer bid).
   * 4â™£ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4â™£ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

### Over Interference
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are â€œon.â€ For example:

1NT â€” (Double) â€” 2â™£ = Stayman

1NT â€” (Double) â€” 2â™¦ = transfer to hearts

If an opponent bids over your 1NT opener, conventional responses like Stayman
and transfers are â€œoff.â€ Bids are natural except for a cuebid, which can be used with
game forcing strength as a substitute for Stayman.

If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, â€œIâ€™m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.â€

1NT â€” (Pass) â€” 2â™¦ â€” (Double) â€” 2â™¥ = Real fit for hearts â€” pass with only two hearts
## 2NT and 3NT 
Stayman and Jacoby transfers for the majors are used.

### 2NT 20-21
   * 3â™£ = Stayman.
   * 3â™¦, 3â™¥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively.
   * 4â™£ = Gerber (ace asking).
   * 4NT = Invites a slam in notrump.

### 3NT 25-27
   * 4â™£ = Stayman.
   * 4â™¦, 4â™¥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively
# Major Openings 
Normally open five-card majors in all seats.

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.

## Responses 
### Basic Responses Over 1â™¥
   * 1â™  = at least four spades, 6 or more points. Tends to deny a heart fit.
   * 1NT = 6â€“10 points, denies four spades or three hearts. NOT forcing.
   * 2â™£, 2â™¦ = 11 points or more, promises at least four of the suit.
   * 2â™¥ = three-card or longer heart support; 6â€“10 dummy points.
   * 2â™ , 3â™£, 3â™¦ = strong jump shifts. Invites a slam.
   * 3â™¥ = limit raise (10â€“12 dummy points with three or more hearts).
   * 3NT = 15â€“17 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.
   * 4â™¥ = usually five+ hearts, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

### Basic Responses Over 1â™ 
Same as above except:
   * 2â™¥ = 11 points or more, promises at least five of the suit.
### Jacoby 2NT
Over a 1â™¥ or 1â™  opening
   * 2NT = Game-forcing raise (Jacoby 2NT), 13+ dummy points. Asks
opener to show a short suit to help responder evaluate slam prospects.
If opener has no short suit, he shows his hand strength;
      * 3â™£, 3â™¦, 3â™  = singleton or void in that suit. Other bids deny a short suit.
      * 4â™¥ = minimum hand.
      * 3NT = medium hand (15â€“17).
      * 3â™¥ = maximum hand (18+)
## Rebids by Opener 
Openerâ€™s rebids are natural and standard.
### Rebids with a minimum hand (13â€“16 points)
   * Rebidding notrump at the lowest available level;
   * Raising responderâ€™s suit at the lowest level (may have good three-card support);
   * Rebidding a new suit at the one level or rebidding a new suit at the two level that
is lower ranking than the opening suit (not reversing);
   * Rebidding openerâ€™s suit at the lowest level.

### Rebids with a medium hand (17â€“18 points)
   * Jump raise or jump rebid of openerâ€™s suit;
   * Reverse in a new suit, i.e., bid a new suit at the two level which is higher ranking
than the opening suit;
   * Non-reverse bid in a new suit (this has the wide range of 13â€“18 points)

### With a maximum hand (19â€“21 or 22 points) opener must make a very strong rebid:
   * Jump in notrump;
   * Double jump raise of responderâ€™s suit or double jump rebid of openerâ€™s suit;
   * Jump shift in a new suit.

Responder follows up by attempting to sign off in game, bidding 4NT
Blackwood, or cuebidding if still interested in trying to cooperate with opener
in making the slam decision.

## Subsequent Bidding by Responder 
If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about openerâ€™s hand.


Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

1â™¥ â€” 1â™ 

2â™£ â€” Pass, 2â™¥, 2â™  = 6â€“10 points, sign-off in partscore.

Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, 3 of a previously bid suit:

1â™¥ â€” 1â™ 

2â™¦ â€” 2NT, 3â™¦, 3â™¥, 3â™  = 11â€“12 points, inviting game.

After opener rebids in a suit, a new suit by responder is forcing. If the new suit is the
fourth suit, the bid may be artificial/conventional.

1â™¥ â€” 1â™ 

2â™£ â€” 2â™¦ = one-round force, could be conventional.

However, after a 1NT rebid by opener, bids of a new suit at the next higher level are
non-forcing.

1â™¥ â€” 1â™ 

1NT â€” 2â™£, 2â™¦ = non-forcing. Responder must jump shift to 3â™£ or 3â™¦ to force game.
Second-round forcing bids following a 1NT rebid by opener: a reverse or jump shift
into a new suit is a game force.

1â™£ â€” 1â™¥

1NT â€” 2â™  or 3â™¦ = game force.

Bids available for signing off in game.

3NT, 4â™¥, 4â™ , 5â™£, 5â™¦.

If responder initially bids a new suit at the two level, the same rules apply EXCEPT
that a subsequent jump raise of openerâ€™s first suit to the THREE LEVEL is game
forcing â€” responder should make a limit raise directly over the opening with 10â€“12
points and at least three-card support:

1â™  â€” 2â™£

2â™¥ â€” 2NT, 3â™£, 3â™¥ = Invitation to game (11â€“12 points).

â€” 2â™  = preference, not forcing. Responder has 11â€“12 points and a
 doubleton spade.

 â€” 3â™¦ = game force, could be conventional.

 â€” 3â™  = game force.5

NOTE: Responder promises to bid again if he responded with a new suit at the two
level unless openerâ€™s rebid is at the game level.

1â™  â€” 2â™£

2â™¦ = forcing one round. Responder can limit his hand by bidding 2â™ , 2NT, 3â™£,
or 3â™¦ at this point. He should not pass, since opener could have 18
points (just short of a jump shift rebid).
